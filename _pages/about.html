    <p>The cream of my career crop includes work with <a href="/portfolio/booking-payments">Booking.com</a> in the Netherlands, Harvard University in the USA, the <a href="/portfolio/cdp">New South Wales Government</a> and <a href="/portfolio/gsq">Queensland Government</a> in Australia.</p>
    <p>I've been working remotely for years now, across consulting, strategy, <a href="/disciplines/design">design</a>, development, and all sorts of technologies like <a href="/disciplines/design#web">web</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#mobile">mobile</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#xr">AR and VR</a>. I take pride in the fact that I'm a <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/the-dawn-of-the-indie-maker-d8d35668560d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital generalist</a> ‚Äî¬†someone who, alone, can produce the work of entire teams of people ‚Äî often working faster and producing quality results.</p>
    <p>Remote design sprint facilitation is one of my specialties. I've <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/how-to-run-remote-design-sprints-6145b1d512a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpM_FO3ucQA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted a webinar</a> where I shared my design sprint process, and how I've innovated with teams from all over the globe.</p>
    <p>Outside of my professional work I love to travel and take photos as I go.</p>

    <p>I also <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a> occasionally. Mostly web and design related, but also on completely unrelated topics like <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/a-photographic-journey-through-wondrous-bali-and-java-71a53457c379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Photographic Journey Through Wondrous Bali and Java</a> and <a href="The monster guide to starting a drone photography business in Australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The monster guide to starting a drone photography business in Australia</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>My goal is to partner with companies who are looking for a digital generalist, with a keen eye for design, to help them create new digital products, or to elevate existing products to their full potential.</strong> I'm open to being hired on a per-project basis, but I'm also open to forming partnerships with successful companies in need of an all-rounder digital specialist with a level of strategic involvement. If that strikes a chord <a href="mailto:damirkotoric@gmail.com?subject=Saying hello via your website&body=Hi Damir," target="_blank">please do get in touch</a>.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do you charge?</h3>
    <p>I charge hourly, or per project stage. For eCommerce projects, I'm also open to value-based pricing, where I don't charge anything at the start of a project, but take an agreed upon percentage of online sales. </p>
    <h4>Hourly rate</h4>
    <p>I charge per hour for short-term projects. <a href="mailto:damirkotoric@gmail.com?subject=Saying hello via your website&body=Hi Damir," target="_blank">Send me and email</a> with information about your project and I'll provide my rate and availability.</p>
    <h4>Project stage pricing</h4>
    <p>I can offer fixed pricing for particular project stages. That is, if your project is brand new, I can offer a fixed price amount for the exploration phase. Then another fixed price amount for the design phase, another for the build, and so on. I don't do fixed amounts for entire projects. It's impossible to estimate an entire project right at the start. Therefore, I can offer fixed amounts for each stage within a project.</p>
    <h4>Value based pricing</h4>
    <p>Applicable to eCommerce sites, this is an arrangement where you don't pay me a single cent to research, design, build and market your site, but in return I take an agreed upon percentage from every sale going forward. I review each applicant for value based pricing, and don't always offer this. Because of the risk incurred on my end, I carefully qualify potential clients for value-based pricing.</p>
    <p>These are the 3 different pricing options that I provide. Every project is unique, so I'll customise the approach to your project and needs. I usually offer a few different pricing options for potential clients to choose from.</p>
    <h3>Do you ask clients to sign a contract?</h3>
    <p>Yes. I'm a big believer in common sense, mature discussion and creating a legacy of win-win interactions with clients. Having said that, I do ask new clients to read through and electronically sign <a href="/assets/pdf/damir-kotoric-new-client-contract.pdf" target="_blank">my contract</a> (keep in mind this is just a guide and you'll receive a contract catered to you). I've taken extra care to write it in a way that's easy to understand. The purpose of the contract is to lay some ground rules and expectations. Of course, you can decide to stop our working arrangement at any time.</p>
    <h3>Are you open to partnerships?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in fact I'm looking to partner with existing businesses where I can act as their Head of Digital, helping them transform their business, helping them automate and sell their products online.</p>
    <h3>How can you do all your work remotely?</h3>
    <p>Information travels over the internet, and my work is information work. It's as simple as that. All my work can be done from wherever there is a fast internet connection. I've been working remotely for years with organisations like Envato, Harvard University, the New South Wales Government and Queensland Government, and with teams spread across the USA, Europe, Asia, Africa and across Australia.</p>
    <p>With every client I agree to a time where we sync up over a video call. Usually once or twice a week. There's chat for everything else.</p>
    <h3>Are you a one-man show or do you leverage other specialists?</h3>
    <p>When it comes to design work, I'm a one-man show. When it comes to advanced web and app development, that's where I might leverage other specialists. It depends on the project. And this is something we can discuss after I hear what you're in need of. Even when specific specialists need to be involved, I can tap into my professional network to help find the right people. I can also act as project manager throughout the project. But you'll always know if, and who would be involved. In the vast majority of project it's either just myself, or myself working in collaboration with the client's development team.</p>
