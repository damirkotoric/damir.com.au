  <p>The cream of my career crop includes work with <a href="/portfolio/booking-payments">Booking.com</a> in the Netherlands, Harvard University in the USA, the <a href="/portfolio/cdp">New South Wales Government</a> and <a href="/portfolio/gsq">Queensland Government</a> in Australia.</p>
  <p>I've been working remotely for years now, across consulting, strategy, <a href="/disciplines/design">design</a>, development, and all sorts of technologies like <a href="/disciplines/design#web">web</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#mobile">mobile</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#xr">AR and VR</a>. I take pride in the fact that I'm a <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/the-dawn-of-the-indie-maker-d8d35668560d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital generalist</a> ‚Äî¬†someone who, alone, can produce the work of entire teams of people ‚Äî often working faster and producing quality results.</p>
  <p>Remote design sprint facilitation is one of my specialties. I've <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/how-to-run-remote-design-sprints-6145b1d512a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpM_FO3ucQA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted a webinar</a> where I shared my design sprint process, and how I've innovated with teams from all over the globe.</p>
  <p>I also <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write about web and app design</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>My goal is to partner with companies who are looking for a digital generalist, with a keen eye for design, to help them create new digital products, or to elevate existing products to their full potential.</strong> I'm open to being hired on a per-project basis, but I'm also open to forming partnerships with successful companies in need of an all-rounder digital specialist with a level of strategic involvement. If that strikes a chord <a href="mailto:damirkotoric@gmail.com?subject=Saying hello via your website&body=Hi Damir," target="_blank">please do get in touch</a>.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <h3>How do you charge?</h3>
  <p>I charge per hour, and at the start of every month I'll send you an invoice with hours worked in the previous month, along with a time tracking report from <a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank">Toggl</a>. <a href="mailto:damirkotoric@gmail.com?subject=Saying hello via your website&body=Hi Damir," target="_blank">Send me and email</a> with information about your project and I'll provide my rate and availability.</p>
  <h3>Do you ask clients to sign a contract?</h3>
  <p>Yes. I'm a big believer in common sense, mature discussion and creating a legacy of win-win interactions with clients. Having said that, I do ask new clients to read through and electronically sign <a href="/assets/pdf/damir-kotoric-new-client-contract.pdf" target="_blank">my contract</a> (keep in mind this is just a guide and you'll receive a contract catered to you). I've taken extra care to write it in a way that's easy to understand. The purpose of the contract is to lay some ground rules and expectations. Of course, you're not locked in and can decide to stop our working arrangement at any time.</p>
  <h3>Are you experienced in remote work?</h3>
  <p>I've been working remotely for a longer time than most digital designers. First, I started working remotely in 2015 at Envato, and have since worked remotely with Harvard University, Australian government organisations, and teams spread across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
  <p>With every client I'll agree to a time where we sync up over a video call. Usually once or twice a week. Then we'll use chat for everything else.</p>
  <h3>Are you a one-man show or do you leverage other specialists?</h3>
  <p>When it comes to design work, I'm a one-man show. When it comes to web and app development, that's where I work with other specialists to bring the designs to life. When specific specialists like 3D artists, illustrators and software engineers need to be involved, I can tap into my professional network to help find the right people.</p>
  <h3>How do you like to collaborate?</h3>
  <p>I like to meet with you in a video call initially because it allows us to get a better feel for who we are and to get to know each other a little. On an ongoing basis, I like to do as much as possible outside of meetings. My approach is async first. Outside of my <a href="/services/design-sprint-facilitation">design sprint workshops</a>, I like to spend as little time as possible in meetings, and as much time as possible tackling the actual work at hand. Having said that, I find that it's good practice to sync up face-to-face once a week, or once a fortnight.</p>
