    <p>The cream of my career crop includes work with <a href="/portfolio/booking-payments">Booking.com</a> in the Netherlands, Harvard University in the USA, <a href="/portfolio/ga">General Assembly</a>, the <a href="/portfolio/cdp">New South Wales</a> and Queensland governments in Australia. It all started humbly working at a local digital agency in my Australian hometown in Geelong, and progressed to working in different metropolises, and now working remote.</p>
    <p>I've been working remotely for years now, across consulting, strategy, <a href="/disciplines/design">design</a>, development, and all sorts of technologies like <a href="/disciplines/design#web">web</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#mobile">mobile</a>, <a href="/disciplines/design#xr">AR and VR</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/the-dawn-of-the-indie-maker-d8d35668560d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I predict that the "next big thing" is the dawn of the multidisciplinary indie maker</a>, and generalists like myself, who alone can produce the work of entire teams of people ‚Äî often working faster and producing great results.</p>
    <p>Remote design workshops are another of my specialties. I've <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/how-to-run-remote-design-sprints-6145b1d512a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpM_FO3ucQA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted a webinar</a> where I shared my design sprint process, and how I've innovated with teams from all over the globe.</p>
    <p>Outside of my professional work I love to travel and take photos as I go.</p>

    <p>I also <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a> occasionally. Mostly web and design related, but also on completely unrelated topics like <a href="https://medium.com/@damirkotoric/a-photographic-journey-through-wondrous-bali-and-java-71a53457c379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Photographic Journey Through Wondrous Bali and Java</a> and <a href="The monster guide to starting a drone photography business in Australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The monster guide to starting a drone photography business in Australia</a>.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to partner with other ambitious people, and for us to create successful digital projects. I'm open to being hired on a per-project basis, but I'm also open to forming partnerships with successful companies in need of an all-rounder digital specialist with a level of strategic involvement. If that strikes a chord <a href="mailto:damirkotoric@gmail.com?subject=Saying hello via your website&body=Hi Damir," target="_blank">please do get in touch</a>.</p>
