  <p>No-nonsense design that "just works" — that's my philosophy. Design that’s simple, functional, accessible, performant and pleasing to the eye.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in the end products of my work, I suggest you take a look at <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. Here, I'll go through the process of <em>how</em> I design. New projects often start with a design sprint. Following that, I create the blueprint for the product experience — how the app (or site) will look and work. <strong>The deliverables are a prototype, a design system and a user testing report which act as blueprints for the full build of the product.</strong></p>

  <p>Just like an architectural blueprint, my design work sets the creative direction for the project. This means that stakeholders know exactly what will be built, and software engineers know exactly what needs to be built. Essentially, it demistifies the project and creates clarity and a product vision.</p>
  <h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>
  <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a prototype is worth a thousand requirement specification documents. Prototypes are the birth of an idea into a tangible form and they are invaluable.</p>
  <p>Prototypes take me from a few days, to a few weeks to create. Building the full product often takes many months. <strong>We can start validating product ideas with about 1/10th of the time and budget by first building and testing a prototype.</strong> Does the potential audience "get it"? Would they know how to use it? Does this idea hold water, or do we need to go back to the drawing board? If we need to change course, we want to find out now. Not months from now. And, that's why prototypes are invaluable.</p>

  <p>I use <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma</a> for prototype creation. It's my all-in-one design, prototyping, and dev handover tool.</p>

  <h3>Testing Prototypes</h3>
  <p>I carry out in-person and remote user testing in order to validate our idea. If it tests well, we'll move to the development phase with confidence. If not, we'll change direction, and try again. Most times I hit the mark pretty close on the first go, and after some quick fine-tuning the development can start.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>User testing report</h3>
  <p>I'll summarise all the insights gained from the user testing, and on most projects I'll send an email or chat message highlighting what I've learned and my recommendations for the next steps.</p>
  <p>Unless specifically requested, I don't prepare the long and boring user testing reports that are common in the industry. Most stakeholders don't care for long academic reports. Instead they just want the key insights in a short and snappy way, so we can continue work. And that's what I deliver.</p>
  <h2 id="system">Design system creation</h2>
  <p>Delivering a bunch of static Photoshop mockups is so 2010. Frameworks like <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material Design</a>, <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbon</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> have paved the way for systemic design, which makes it much easier to scale a product — and easily scalable products are good business.</p>
  <p>My go-to for design system creation is Material Design. I customise a ready-made Figma prototype by specifying the typography, and colour scheme, and voilà! An entire design system is ready to go. Done in minutes, instead of days.</p>
  <p>From here, I design bespoke components as needed. I don't want my work to look like a typical Google UI. And it doesn't. I simply don't utilise the parts to Material Design that aren't great, or don't fit the product at hand. But it is a fantastic foundation to start with, and with tools like <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Material-UI React library</a> it makes dev handover super easy for React codebases.</p>
  <p>I can, of course, design completely bespoke design systems by hand, not utilising any existing frameworks. But these will double (or more) the time and budget needed.</p>
