  <p>No-nonsense design that "just works" — that's my philosophy. Design that’s simple, functional, accessible, performant and pleasing to the eye.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in the end products of my work, I suggest you take a look at <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. Here, I'll go through the process of <em>how</em> I design. New projects often start with a design sprint. Following that, I create the blueprint for the product experience — how the app (or site) will look and work. <strong>The deliverables are a prototype, a design system and a user testing report which act as blueprints for the full build of the product.</strong></p>

  <p>Just like an architectural blueprint, my design work sets the creative direction for the project. This means that stakeholders know exactly what will be built, and software engineers know exactly what needs to be built. Essentially, it demistifies the project and creates clarity and a product vision.</p>
  <h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>
  <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a prototype is worth a thousand requirement specification documents. Prototypes are the birth of an idea into a tangible form and they are invaluable.</p>
  <p>Prototypes take me from a few days, to a few weeks to create. Building the full product often takes many months. <strong>We can start validating product ideas with about 1/10th of the time and budget by first building and testing a prototype.</strong> Does the potential audience "get it"? Would they know how to use it? Does this idea hold water, or do we need to go back to the drawing board? If we need to change course, we want to find out now. Not months from now. And, that's why prototypes are invaluable.</p>

  <h3>Testing Prototypes</h3>
  <p>I validate our idea by testing the prototype with potential users.</p>

    <figcaption>A small selection of insights gained from user testing prototypes on target audience.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>If the prototype tests well, we'll move to the development phase with confidence. If not, we'll change direction, and try again. Most times I hit the mark pretty close on the first go, and after some quick fine-tuning the development can start.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>User testing report</h3>
  <p>I'll summarise all the insights gained from the user testing, and on most projects I'll send an email or chat message highlighting what I've learned and my recommendations for the next steps.</p>

    <figcaption>Different user research reports from quick status update messages to in-depth multi-page reports. Small projects need fast turnaround, and quick and short dot points for next steps. Big projects sometimes require a more thorough testing strategy and analysis.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Unless specifically requested, I don't prepare the long and boring user testing reports that are common in the industry. Most stakeholders don't care for long academic reports. Instead they just want the key insights in a short and snappy way, so we can continue work. And that's what I deliver.</p>
  <h2 id="system">Design system creation</h2>
  <p>Delivering a bunch of static Photoshop mockups is so 2010. Frameworks like <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material Design</a>, <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbon</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> have paved the way for design systems. In a nutshell, design systems make for scalable design. Scalable design makes for scalable products, and scalable products make for scalable and financially successful businesses.</p>
  <figure class="-full">
    <img src="/assets/images/design-system.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1069">
    <figcaption>Customised Material Design components.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>For fast-turnaround projects I regularly utilise <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material Design</a> as a foundation for new design systems. Material design is incredibly flexible, comes with dozens of UI components ready to go, and with tools like <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material-UI React library</a> it makes dev handover easy on React codebases. And if you do it right, as I do, the end result doesn't end up looking like a typical Google UI. As I said, it's flexible and can be customised to any brand or creative direction.</p>
  <figure class="-contain">
    <img src="/assets/images/orpheus-storybook.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800">
    <figcaption>I helped create <a href="http://storybook.orphe.us/" target="_blank">the Orpheus UI library</a> which utilises <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storybook</a> and <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material-UI</a> to quickly set up a design system for an archive product in the humanities.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Even for larger projects I default to starting with the material design approach because it's a fast, tried and proven method. But for some projects, like iOS apps where Material Design isn't applicable or some projects where uniquness is key, I'll start with a completely blank canvas.</p>
  <h2 id="web">Designing for web</h2>
  <p>I've designed responsive, performant, SEO-friendly and accessible websites for Envato, <a href="/portfolio/booking-payments">Booking.com</a>, the New South Wales government, Harvard University professors, and many startups.</p>

  <p>I both design and develop web UIs. On some projects I lead the design effort, and hand over design deliverables to devs. On other projects I go all the way and code up the UI using HTML/CSS/jQuery. <a href="">More on my web dev skills.</a></p>

  <p>Designing for the web requires more than just an eye for design. One must think about the limitations of web technologies, and create a universal experience for an evergrowing list of browsers and devices. Simplicity is a designer's best friend when designing for web.</p>
  
  <h2 id="mobile">Designing for mobile</h2>
  <p>I use the same prototyping process that I describe above to create high-fidelity, engaging designs for iOS and Android. <strong>My design phiolosphy is heavily influenced by Apple and their motto "it just works".</strong> I'm a big fan of simplicity and I'll often reference great apps like the App Store app, Twitter, Slack, Telegram, Spotify, and others, during my app design process.</p>
  <p>A word on designing for iOS and Android. Each platform has its own intricacies. iOS has no physical back button, permissions are granted individually, a bottom bar is often used for global navigation. Android, on the other hand, primarily utilises "drawer menu" global navigation, floating actions buttons for a view's primary action, radio buttons instead of check boxes for multi-select lists (weird). Each platform has its own pros and cons, and it's important to know them, but what's even more important is to design an app that feels "just right" to the user on that platform.</p>
  <p>I aim to create a balance between creating bespoke components and utilising native components, and further balancing the differences between iOS and Android. But <strong>what always matters most is that the app produces the desired outcome — that users love it, that it's easy-to-use, that it keeps users engaged.</strong></p>
