  <p>Can we make visible what is naked to the naked eye, and can we thereby reveal stories that were previously untold?</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Blenheim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Historic Blenheim</a> is a 19th century heritage site in Fairfax, Virginia. It was a site during the American Civil War, and the interior of the building holds century-old graffiti. Following laser scanning done by a <a href="http://rbtoth.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team of laser scanning specialists</a>, we now have images where we can see inscriptions that were previously invisible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>This is where my team came in. My responsibility was to lead the design efforts on creating an AR app that would make these laser scans visible to site visitors.</p>

    <figcaption>Telling the story. The AR app would guide visitors around the interior of the heritage site, and explain the details behind each inscription.</figcaption>

  <p>Site visitors would arrive to the site, see the app advertised, download the app, and then explore the site and use it as a sort of x-ray device.</p>

    <figcaption>Seeing the unseen. Using the AR app visitors can see inscriptions that are invisible to the naked eye.</figcaption>

  <p>In about a day's work, I completed the conceptual design mockups, which allowed my team to sync up with the project stakeholders around the expectations of the app, and build cost estimates.</p>
