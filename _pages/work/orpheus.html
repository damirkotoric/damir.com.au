  <p><a href="https://orphe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orpheus</a> is a digital collection tool built by Cambridge startup <a href="https://archimedes.digital/" target="_blank">Archimedes Digital</a>, and aimed at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard University</a>, <a href="http://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>, and humanities professors and archivists around the world.</p>
  <p>My role was a mix of product design, product management and UI development. My title was Lead Design Strategist, but my tasks includes everything from strategy, user and market research, design, front-end development, quality analysis, and design sprint facilitation.</p>

  <h2>Meet the target audience.</h2>
  <p>Our primary target were seasoned archivists and humanities professors that wanted to digitise their collections, and make them available for viewing online. But, we also wanted to support hobbyists.</p>

    <figcaption>The target audience for Orpheus — the Tech-Savvy Archivist, the Hardline Traditionalist and the Hobbyist Collector.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Our first beta users were composed of tech-savvy archivists and hobbyists, and our plan was to build a compelling enough product to convert the hardline print-only traditionalists as well. We wanted to make archiving accessible and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

  <h2><a href="/services/design-sprint-facilitation">Remote design sprint workshops</a> lighting the product path ahead.</h2>
  <p>Early on, I helped the team realign their strategy. The product initially suffered from scope creep and a fragmented user experience. My job was to clarify what we're building exactly, and thereby reel in the feature list and create a more standardised user experience.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>A <a href="https://medium.com/@steve_mullen/an-introduction-to-lean-canvas-5c17c469d3e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean canvas</a> workshop helped clarify the business goals and limitations that we're designing within. Next, we narrowed down on our target audience, and collaborated on an <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kyakl3o=/?moveToWidget=3074457346483907950&cot=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspiration board</a> to get the product ideas out of our heads and onto a digital whiteboard.</p>

It helps the team share ideas and sync on the high-level direction we want to pursue.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The design sprint workshops here were done with a distributed team of six across different locations and time zones, with me doing the product analysis and user research ahead of time.</p>
  <h2>One design system to rule all platforms.</h2>
  <p>Orpheus is bringing digital collections and exhibitions to any device. I aimed for a simple, minimalist, no-nonsense design aesthetic, even as the product requirements kept piling in. I adopted the philosophy that Orpheus should be like an art gallery. The UI, like the exhibition space in an art gallery, recedes into the background, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054090/why-content-reigns-supreme-in-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowing the content to take the spotlight</a>.</p>

  <h2>Cross-cultural design for an international audience.</h2>
  <p>We aimed to build a digital collection tool for all of the world's cultures. This means <a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/design-for-internationalization-24c12ea6b38f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following internationalisation best practices</a>, and being mindful about choosing the right typography that can support the widest possible number of languages.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>After weighing the pros and cons of different type setups, I ended up choosing Noto Sans as the typeface of choice. I considered using system fonts initially, but even system fonts don't support a lot of minority scripts. In that regard, one typeface stood above all others — <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noto</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noto</a> typeface project is a great feat in humanistic design. A typeface that supports over 500 languages. Simple, elegant and available in both serif and sans serif — the perfect choice for Orpheus.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h2>Experiments in VR.</h2>
  <p>With Orpheus, we wanted to create a home for digital exhibitions, supporting 2D interfaces, but also in the most immersive tech available — virtual reality.</p>
  <figure>

  </figure>
  <p>Rapid prototyping tools for VR are still in their infancy, but I managed to put the above prototype together using a combination of Figma and <a href="https://www.vr.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vrooms</a>. This allowed us to quickly and cheaply experiment with the VR experience, before committing to the expensive and time-consuming build of a VR app.</p>
  <h2>Growing an ambitious startup.</h2>
  <p>The trick with building Orpheus was to cater as many possible use cases as possible without sinking into feature creep, and without overspecialising the product to one particular domain.
