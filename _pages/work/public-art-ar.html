  <p>What if you could turn a city neighbourhood into an open air museum?</p>
  <p><abbr title="augmented reality">AR</abbr> opens up new creative possibilities, and my job with this project was to explore a prototype for an app that tells the stories of the 20th century immigrants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_End,_Boston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston's most iconic neighbourhood</a>.</p>

  <h2>Mind sharing your camera and location?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/why-permission-priming-is-good-ux-19c675754dbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good permission priming</a> is key with AR apps. We need both the user's geolocation and camera access to make the AR experience work. Those are among the most sensitive personal details that an app can ask for, therefore this the most critical part of the onboarding experience.</p>

  <h2>The square.</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Square_(Boston,_Massachusetts)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Square</a> is a central gathering ground of the North End neighbourhood.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>A special bronze cast plaque was installed here as part of the square's recent restoration. As part of this, I explored an AR feature which would interact with the bronze map to give users another overview of where they can find stories.</p>
