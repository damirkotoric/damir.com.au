      <h1>Designing Payments at Booking.com</h1>
      <p>I lead the effort for a redesigned payment experience on Booking.com — the world’s biggest accommodation site.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Booking.com is the world’s biggest accommodation site, and world’s 3rd biggest eCommerce site. In 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booking_Holdings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booking made just over USD $14 billion in revenue</a> — that’s “tres commas” territory.</p>
  <p>At Booking, <strong>I lead the initial effort to redesign the payment system</strong> that processes tens of millions of euros worth of transactions per day.</p>

  <h2>Impact made</h2>
  <p>Due to the confidential nature of this work, I cannot disclose the exact monetary impact, but let’s say it was “very significant” — in the tens of millions of Euros per year.</p>
  <h3>A versus B</h3>
  <p>All iterations to the Booking.com website are A/B tested before they go live. Booking’s systems for data-informed decision making made my jaw drop. The extent of data available is just astounding.</p>
  <p>Booking's A/B test system is confidential. But let's say there are hundreds, if not thousands of data points to consider in every experiment.</p>
  <h2>Facilitating a design workshop</h2>
  <p>First on the agenda was performing some research to identify the current payment experience, keeping on the lookout for problem areas and opportunities for improving the user experience.</p>

  <h2>The complexities of design for a global payment system</h2>
  <p>Companies like Booking deal with payments in many different ways, but more or less their model can be grouped into one of two ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The Amazon / Apple model</strong> of accepting only debit/credit card payment and one system of payment where you pay for everything at once. Nice and simple, but limited in flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>The Booking model</strong> of accepting over a dozen different payment methods and half a dozen ways of paying. You may choose to pay for everything with a card. But, you may also choose to pay in instalments using Paypal. Or, you may choose to pay some of your booking up front using a debit card and the rest at the hotel using cash.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Booking’s approach is more inclusive, makes more business sense, and is more empathic to the user. <a href="https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WeChat Pay and Alipay, for example, are the most popular payment methods in China</a>, for example. Booking caters to these customers allowing them to use their favourite payment method. That’s good customer service.</p>

    <figcaption>A payment modal — an early direction we tried and chose not to pursue.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>But this model creates complexity. Lots of complexity.</p>
  <p>Complicated enough? We’re not done yet. Booking supports over 50 different currencies, is available in over 140 different countries, and over 40 languages.</p>
  <p>Let’s not forget, we need to cater to mobile web, desktop web, iOS and Android platforms, too.</p>
  <p>The idea is to create a very flexible payment system, and to try to thereby future-proof it as much as can be done in an ever-changing industry.</p>
  <h2>Prototype early</h2>
  <p>Good research is imperative. But I don’t like to spend weeks and months researching, in order to aim for the perfect solution. Instead, I create a prototype early, using it as a tool for user research.</p>

    <figcaption>Early prototype of a potential new payment system for the Booking.com ecosystem.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h2>User testing insights</h2>
  <p>Using this prototype, I performed some remote user testing with <a href="http://usertesting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usertesting.com</a>, then watched the videos of participants completing the test tasks, and compiled all learnings into an easy-to-digest report.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>We had a lot of our assumptions confirmed. That users wanted a summary next to the "Pay" button, for example.</p>
  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>With a company of over 10K employees and some 300 designers alone, you can expect some red tape around the process of redesigning the heart of the main booking flow. Our work here was a starting point. A way for people to rally around the idea of a new payment system.</p>
  <h2>Lighting the initial spark</h2>
  <p>What my team achieved here was to help create that initial spark for an overhaul of the payment system. One that would make for happier users, and that would help the company grow. And that’s exactly what happened.</p>
  <p>Roughly a year after this initial effort a brand new payment system was rolled out on Booking.com.</p>
