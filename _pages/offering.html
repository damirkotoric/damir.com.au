        <p>First on the agenda — understanding your current situation.</p>
        <p>In my experience, <span class="highlight">the majority of projects need lots of help early on</span>. Too many unvalidated assumptions, poor strategy, bloated apps, scope creep, lack of focus and lack of vision. We want to become aware of all possible risks and tackle them head-on.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>I want to learn everything about your project. If you have an existing product that you’d like improved, then I’ll first review it.</p>
        <h6>Product Review</h6>
        <p>An in-depth, no-nonsense product teardown, getting into the details of what’s working, what isn’t, and suggestions for improvements.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="offeringItemContentInner">
        <h6>1-Page Project Plan</h6>
        <p>Depending on the project, I may put together a one-pager, called a LEAN Canvas in startup lingo, to act as a guiding compass for all work to come.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="offeringItemContentImage">

      <div class="offeringItemContentInner">
        <p>Essentially, this is a one-page plan noting the most important factors for the project. Factors like success metrics, unique value proposition, unfair advantage, and early adopters.</p>
        <h3>Strategy, without the long-winded fluff.</h3>
        <p>You’ll receive a <span class="highlight">one-pager</span> of dot points of my key findings and recommendations. Simple. The point here is to steer the project in the right direction, and fast.</p>
        <p>With us knowing where we need to “steer the ship”, it’s time to commence the journey.</p>

        <p>I specialise in concept work and prototyping. Turning vague ideas, into visual mockups, and turning visual mockups into clickable prototypes — <em>fast</em>.</p>
        <h6>Moodboarding.</h6>
        <p>It all starts with gathering inspiration. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqEcg3TTHJg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good ideas don't spring out of nowhere.</a> Creativity is taking known elements, and combining them in unique ways. And the foundation of all this is a moodboard.</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/moodboard.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333">
      </div>
      <div class="offeringItemContentInner">
        <p>To collaborate on moodboards I use a tool called Miro, which is basically a whiteboard in the cloud. <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kyakl3o=/?moveToWidget=3074457346483907950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See an example moodboard.</a> And I'll invite you to add your own ideas to it. I'm happy to own this process, but I'm also just as happy to collaborate.</p>
        <h6>Design and prototyping.</h6>
        <p><span class="highlight">Simply put, prototypes are amazing.</span> Why? Because prototypes allow us to quickly test complex and expensive ideas in less than 10% of the budget of a full build. Because they assure us that we're heading in the right direction, and if not, they enable us to correct course, very early.</p>

        <h6>Talking shop.</h6>
        <p>I code HTML, CSS, jQuery on the front-end, and leverage a <a href="https://jamstack.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAMStack</a> architecture using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a> for things like user account systems, DNS management, serverless functions, HTTPS.

        <p>VR apps, games, native apps or highly complex server-side apps. I can still design and prototype these, but we'll involve a corresponding software engineer for the build. I'll advise you when that's the case.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the internet meeting rooms are optional.

        <h6><a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>.</h6>
        <p>No more information silos, and "who has that file?". The whole team uses one central place for all documents, spreadsheets, etc. These are so ubiquoutous, they shouldn't even be on the list, but every now and then I run into the odd company that still forwards attachments of .DOCX files via email.</p>
        <h6><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trello</a></h6>
        <p>Todo lists, sales leads, orders, project boards, you name it. Trello is the ultimate management tool. <a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asana</a> is a solid alternative.</p>
        <h6><a href="https://shopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a></h6>
        <p>If you want an eCommerce site, there's no easier way to get up and running. Works great in collaboration with <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> to handle payments.</p>
        <h6><a href="https://zapier.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a></h6>
        <p>"When a customer submits a feedback form, automatically notify our Slack channel, and send me a mobile notification", or "When a new sale is made in store, add an order in the spreadsheet, and automatically send an order request to the manufacturer."</p>
        <p>Zapier is the ultimate automation Swiss Army Knife. Once set up, you don't have to do anything. It just works.</p>
        <h6><a href="https://www.typeform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typeform</a></h6>
        <p>Beautiful customer surveys, hiring forms, and data entry that people actually fill out. Connects with Zapier, so you can get notifications on your phone when someone fills out a "Get a quote" form, for example.</p>
