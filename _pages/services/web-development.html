  <p>I've written and pushed code live on high profile sites receiving millions of visitors per day. Sites where it's absolutely essential that code is reviewed and meets quality criteria. Sites like <a href="https://themeforest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Envato Market</a> and <a href="https://booking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booking.com</a>. I approach web development the way I do design, with an eye for detail and motivation to produce high quality work — with no time to waste.</p>
  <h2>Sites I've contributed to</h2>
  <p>In collaboration with teams of developers.</p>

  <h2>What I build</h2>
  <h3>UI development</h3>
  <p>I build static sites, like the website you're viewing right now, and I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> as my static site framework of choice. I code in HTML, CSS and jQuery. Simple, proven, and effective. I use Git for version control and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> for collaboration with other developers.</p>
  <h3>Vue.js, React.js, Node.js and Rails theming</h3>
  <p>I don't normally take on entire builds using these frameworks, but I have interacted with them enough in the past in order to collaborate with other developers and handle UI theming on these projects. I'll pull the repo down, theme the UI and push the branch to Github — a much faster and more pleasant experience than a million back-and-forths where I ask devs to nudge pixels around.</p>
  <h2>What I don't do</h2>
  <p>If you're looking to build advanced sites like Twitter and Facebook; or apps like Uber, Spotify, or AR and mobile games, then I'll scout for a software engineer who can bring our vision to life. I'll collaborate with them and quality control the build to make sure that the final product is built to pixel-perfection. I can discuss this with you before we start a new project.</p>
  <h2>Quality code</h2>
  <p>I cast a designer's eye for detail over the output of my work, but importantly, I also make sure that the code itself is of high quality.</p>

    <figcaption>I aim for 90+ scores on Google Chrome DevTools audits. This is an industry standard tool to measure code quality.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h3>Responsive</h3>
  <p>I create sites that cater to mobile, tablet, and desktop — designed to fit any screen, on all <a href="https://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/what_is_an_evergreen_browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern devices</a>.</p>
  <h3>Accessible</h3>
  <p>Simple design makes for accessible design, and here I similarly aim for 90+ scores on the Chrome DevTools audit. This meets the criteria for the majority of products. I've also worked on Booking.com's accessibility team where we went beyond <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.0</a> compliance and conducted accessibility testing with customers with disabilities.</p>
  <h3>Performant</h3>
  <p>If your site doesn't load quickly, then <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors will abandon it</a>. Plain and simple. The definition of "fast enough" varies from site to site. Users expect a product page to load in a snap of their fingers, but it's okay for a 3D virtual tour to take a little longer. It's all about context. My rule of thumb is to optimise performance for 90+ scores on Chrome's DevTools.</p>
  <h3><abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> optimised</h3>
  <p>By following proper accessibility standards, we're half way there when it comes to optimising your website to appear high on Google search results. Again, I am for 90+ scores on Chrome's DevTools for search engine optimisation.</p>
  <h3>Shareable and <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social meta tag optimised</a></h3>
  <p>First impressions matter, and your website will make a first impression even before anyone has visited it. How? Because users see a snippet of your website whenever it is shared on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or via instant messaging. I can always spot the difference between a B-grade and an A-grade website, based on this factor alone, before even opening the link.</p>
